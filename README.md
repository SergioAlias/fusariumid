### This is the FUSARIUM-ID repository for fasta files. 

The repository currently contains a fasta file compilating translation elongation factor 1 alpha (TEF1) sequences representative of the genus _Fusarium_, with metadata associated to each sequence. BLASTing against this file can be used for identification purposes. Fasta files for additional marker loci (e.g. RPB1, RPB2, ITS) will be added in the near future.  

The current version is FUSARIUM-ID v.3.0, which provides the following improvements: 

  (1) additional and updated annotation of metadata for isolates associated with each sequence 

  (2) expanded taxon representation in the TEF1 sequence database 
  
  (3) availability of the database as a downloadable file to enable local BLAST queries
  
  (4) a tutorial file for users to perform local BLAST searches using either freely-available software, such as SequenceServer, BLAST+ executable in the command line, and Galaxy, or the proprietary Geneious software. 
  
Refer to the file **FUSARIUMID_BLAST_Tutorials** for instructions on how to compare TEF sequences to this dataset using four different platforms. The tutorials are available in Spanish under the file name: **FUSARIUMID_BLAST_Tutorials_Español**

New versions will be available in the future.
